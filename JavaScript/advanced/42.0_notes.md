# Javascript and Classes

# do JS really has classes ?
# yes, JS do have classes. But primarily, it is a prototype based language unlike class-based languages (java, C++). Classses in JS are primarily syntactic sugar over the existing prototype based inheritance mechanism. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages.
